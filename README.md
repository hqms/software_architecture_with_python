# Preface 
This is my notes on [Software Architecture with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/software-architecture-with-python/9781786468529) book.
This book written by Anand Balachandran Pillai, and its 556 pages and available in e-book and printed edition. 
Fortunately, I have a printed version of this book, and I don't want to mark or gives notes on that book directly, 
so I write this notes and will push it in my Github repo :)

## Organizing the notes 
My notes will organize in a directory for each chapter. Every note will be written in Jupyter's Notebook. Notes will be 
written as Markdown, while the code will be written as Code. So it will be necessary to have Notebook installed on your 
computer if you want to run directly from the Notebook.

Every packages that required to run codes or Notebook will be listed on requirements.txt, use `pip` to install it.
